# Abandoned

I discovered [Insteon-MQTT](https://github.com/TD22057/insteon-mqtt) after I started this work.  It was much further along and I have contributed all of my efforts their.

This remains solely for reference.

# lib-py-insteon
A python library for interfacing with the Insteon PLM

# Goal
This project intends to be a library for the Insteon platform using the Insteon PLM.  The library will expose a number of functions for directly interfacing with the platform.  The library will also include some form of user interface for configuration of the Insteon platform.  However, it is not envisioned that this library will be used for day to day control of the Insteon platform.  Instead, this library should be incorporated into other Home Automation controllers that have better user interfaces for device control.

# Status
This is still in a very rough state.  In all likelihood the structure and design of the library will change signficantly as I continue to work on it.
